TODO
====

* Add jQuery >= 1.8 dependency to README and note about browser support
* Replace .size() with .length, since the former is deprecated
* Implement the Crayon Syntax Highlighter for code examples https://github.com/aramk/crayon-syntax-highlighter
* Rework fancy events for select (potentially eliminate the need for closeAll)
* Re-evaluate whether the blur timers are needed
* Test mobile
